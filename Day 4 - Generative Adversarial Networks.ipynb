    "# Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "So far, all the models we have worked with except the VAE have been discriminative models. This means that they are simply trying to predit something about our existing dataset. Sometimes, we would not like to discriminate but generate new examples of the data as in the case of video or image generation. Technically, this is the problem of modelling a probability distribution which we have samples of.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach which implicitly models the distribution, the work of Ian Goodfellow, has be enjoying great success - often producing images indistinguishable from the examples on which it was trained. GANs take a game-theoretic approach, pitting two networks against eachother - the discriminator and the generator. The job of the generator is to produce images which are indistinguishable from the training set from latent variables while the job of the discriminator is to catch out the generator and discriminate real data from generated data. Initially they will both be terrible at their jobs but as the discriminator gets better, the generator is forced to get better to fool it and vice-versa. This loop continues until they are both excellent at their jobs and the generator can now be used to produce very realistic data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](GAN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An analogy often used to describe this is the detective and the forger. The generator is like a forger who is trying to produce paintings indistinguishable from other famous paintings by an artists while the discriminator is like a detective who is trying to catch the forger out. As the detective gets better at catching the generator out, the generator is forced to improve to fool the detective."
