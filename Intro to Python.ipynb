    "Classes are basically templates from which we can instantiate objects to use. These classes consist of functions and variables which are shared across each object created from the class though the value of a variable may differ in each object created from the class.<br>\n",
    "All classes should have an initializer functin called __init__ which runs each time an object is instantiated from the class.<br>\n",
    "Each function defined within a class class should take self as a parameter which essentialy means each time the function is run from an object, the changes are made to that specific object. Whenever the function is called, you do not need to pass in self as parameter as it is automatically passed in."
